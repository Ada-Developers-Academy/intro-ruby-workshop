Notes after 3/8 demo

- Didn't get to arrays, finished up conditionals right at 3.5 hours
- Talk about comment keyboard shortcut
- Build in some time to learn how to use repl.it
- Vocab went well
- Missing Vocab
  - Value
  - Intermediate variable came up before it was defined. Maybe organic, not on the slides
- Drilling that literals, variables and method calls are interchangeable was really good
- Did arrays anyway, the practice took like 45 minutes
  - Is there a good way to scaffold it better
  - Or break it out into multiple sections
- Need to write learning goals and review questions for everything
- Conditionals and arrays could use more examples
